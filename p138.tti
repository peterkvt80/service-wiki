OL,11,FIt featured a purple haired girl and a 
OL,12,Fdog, often helped by a bird and a      
OL,13,Fbutterfly. There was no dialog but     
OL,14,Finstead there was music provided by    
OL,15,Fa chamber orchestra that included a    
OL,16,Fharpsichord, glockenspiel, clarinet,
OL,17,Fbassoon and percussion.
