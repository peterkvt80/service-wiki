OL,7,CSubtractive synthesisGstarts with      
OL,8, oscillators and noise sources and then 
OL,9, removes part of the sound by using     
OL,10, filters and attenuators. The rich      
OL,11, harmonics of a triangle or sawtooth    
OL,12, are ideal for the wide range of tones. 
OL,13,

OL,16,Fharmonics. This was made by a simple
