OL,7, Hydraulic pistons and motors are used  
OL,8, in allGsorts of machinery but they     
OL,9, would be useless without control valves
OL,10, to admit high pressure fluid.          
OL,11,F                                       
OL,12,FTo complicate matters the fluid on the 
OL,13,Fother side of the piston needs to be   
OL,14,Fswitched so that it can return to the  
OL,15,Freservoir. The routing is handled by a 
OL,16,Fspindle called a "spool".
