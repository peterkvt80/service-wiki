OL,10,FIt closely resembles sugar except that 
OL,11,Fit is half the calories and half the   
OL,12,Fsweetness. For a diet this is pointless
OL,13,Fbut it has other applications.

OL,15,FIt is good for making sugarcraft shapes
OL,16,Fas it behaves better than sugar. It 
OL,17,Fdoes not absorb water so it does not   
OL,18,Fbecome sticky over time. It does not   
OL,19,Fpromote tooth decay. It does not raise 
OL,20,Fblood sugar levels so it is good for   
OL,21,Fdiabetics. Unfortunately like many     
OL,22,Fcomplex carbohydrates it promotes gas  
OL,23,Fproduction with unfortunate effects.
